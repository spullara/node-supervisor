# node-supervisor

A little supervisor script for nodejs. It runs your program, and
watches for code changes, so you can have hot-code reloading-ish
behavior, without worrying about memory leaks and making sure you
clean up all the inter-module references, and without a whole new
`require` system.

## Easy install

Install npm, and then do this:

    npm install supervisor

## Fancy install

Get the code.

    ./configure && make && sudo make install

## todo

1. Re-attach to a process by pid. If the supervisor is
backgrounded, and then disowned, the child will keep running. At
that point, the supervisor may be killed, but the child will keep
on running. It'd be nice to have two supervisors that kept each
other up, and could also perhaps run a child program.
2. Run more types of programs than just "node blargh.js".
3. Be able to run more than one program, so that you can have two
supervisors supervise each other, and then also keep some child
server up.
4. When watching, it'd be good to perhaps bring up a new child
and then kill the old one gently, rather than just crashing the
child abruptly.
5. Keep the pid in a safe place, so another supervisor can pull
it out if told to supervise the same program.
6. It'd be pretty cool if this program could be run just like
doing `node blah.js`, but could somehow "know" which files had
been loaded, and restart whenever a touched file changes.
7. Remove the C stuff. Just do it all in js, and accept that
shebang won't work in OS X.
